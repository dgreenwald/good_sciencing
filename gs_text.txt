Diagnosed with pericarditis. Physician at the hospital confirmed it was due to the vaccine. Sander Haugrud: ¿A couple of weeks after the second dose, I got a sting in my chest that turned out to be heart bag inflammation. I was on surveillance for three days. I have competed nationally and internationally in kickboxing, since the age of 10 to now. But it¿s a full stop at training and I don¿t know if I can ever train like I did. Now I¿m mostly in prison. This might have been avoided, if I had a corona instead, I guess I¿d be well by now. It is scary to know that no one mentions anything, I had to dig myself to find information, then I found that there were many cases like mine. At the hospital, doctors had a hard time believing the inflammation was due to the vaccine, but in the end the superior admitted it and said to report it to the Drug Enforcement Administration.¿  Videointerview in Norwegian: News Story  News Story2
