# good_sciencing

This repo contains a Python script and text file to show that the Good Sciencing data popularly cited in anti-vaccine arguments

do not actually show any increase in athlete deaths following the introduction of vaccines (January 2021 onward) compared to Maron et al (2006),

https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.804617

which Good Sciencing uses as a pre-vaccine baseline. While Good Sciencing finds 557 deaths/yr compared to 66/yr in Maron et al, the apparent increase in deaths comes from:

(i) Good Sciencing using news reports of all global deaths, while Maron et al restrict to the US (updated GS rate: 557/yr -> 135/yr).

(ii) Good Sciencing uses all ages, while Maron et al restrict to age < 40 years (updated GS rate: 135/yr -> 83/yr).

(iii) Good Sciencing includes former athletes and coaches, while Maron et al restrict to current competitive athletes only (updated GS rate: 83/yr -> 66/yr).

Final result: correctly aligned data sets yield (by amazing coincidence) the exact same 66/yr death rate.
